# TradingLLC - Vite + React + Tailwind starter

This is a minimal starter project for a trading company website (TradingLLC) using **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS**.

## Setup (locally)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Tailwind is already configured (`tailwind.config.cjs` + `postcss.config.cjs`) and `src/index.css` includes the Tailwind directives.

This project is intentionally minimal â€” customize components, add routing, and connect APIs as needed.
